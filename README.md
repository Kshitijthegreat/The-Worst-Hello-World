# The-Worst-Hello-World
The worst Hello world program ever written. Run it! You will not be disappointed.

How this works?

First there is a list of all english characters. The program will loop through the list until the right character is found and then append it to a list. It will be continued until the list is containing the letters - 'Hello, world!'

This program is imported into another program where it is printed through flask on http://localhost:5000.

There is a main.py file which you are needed to start. It will make a tkinter window. There is a button. When you click it the flask app is started. Also, you are redirected to localhost:5000 where you can see the  glorious 'Hello, World!'
